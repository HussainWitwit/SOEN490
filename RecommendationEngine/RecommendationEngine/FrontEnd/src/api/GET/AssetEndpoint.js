/**
 * This is the fetching method for the entity Asset.
 * All the controller logic in the backend shall be 
 * called and processed here. 
 * 
 * 
 * N.B MESSAGE
 * Unfortunately (for now anyways), this is not strongly typed, 
 * so if you make any typo for the object that you receive, 
 * it will yield a runtime error. So Make sure to double-check yourself.
 * If needed, put a bunch of console.log and run the endpoint passed here 
 * in postMan prior to running it in the project.
 * 
 * Ideally, having an object asset declared elsewhere (entities/Asset.js)
 * would have made this implementation more explicit and safe. However, javascript 
 * is weakly typed making this quite redundant and useless. Plus, I got run-time error while trying. 
 * Leaving the folder and file just f.y.i
 * A.J.U.U
